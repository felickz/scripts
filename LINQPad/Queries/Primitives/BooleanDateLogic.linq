DateTime importedUpdatedAt = new DateTime(2024, 1, 11, 7, 0, 0); // 7AM EST 1/11/2024

//Bad
bool recentlyImported = importedUpdatedAt < DateTime.Now.AddHours(-1);
Console.WriteLine("Is Recently Imported?: " + recentlyImported);

//Good
bool recentlyImportedNew = importedUpdatedAt > DateTime.Now.AddHours(-1);
Console.WriteLine("Is Recently Imported(new logic)?: " + recentlyImportedNew);


//Copilot:
//1.hour.ago generates a DateTime that is exactly one hour in the past from the current system time.The < (less than) operator then compares the time stored in repository.import.updated_at with this generated DateTime.
//
//Let's illustrate this with an example:
//
//Say it's currently 2022-01-01 12:00:00 (hh:mm:ss).
//1.hour.ago would return 2022-01-01 11:00:00.
//If repository.import.updated_at was 2022-01-01 10:00:00:
//This date is less than 1.hour.ago (2022-01-01 11:00:00), meaning the update happened MORE than an hour ago.
//If repository.import.updated_at was 2022-01-01 11:30:00:
//This date is not less than 1.hour.ago (2022-01-01 11:00:00), meaning the update happened LESS than an hour ago.
//So repository.import.updated_at< 1.hour.ago checks if the timestamp stored in repository.import.updated_at is more than an hour in the past, i.e., the update happened MORE than an hour ago.
